radarlabviewer
==============

The radar lab viewer is an interactive viewer of simulated radar reflectivities of a model simulation. Initially designed for an undergraduate radar and satellite course, this applet provides the capability to display vertical and horizontal cross sections of a weather scene.

Installation
------------

To download this applet, either for development purposes or to host it yourself, first clone the repository and its submodules:

```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/ethan-nelson/radarlabviewer
```

This applet is generated using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) framework, which is used to generate the case pages from the template. While Jekyll is not required to serve the website, it is still necessary for the generation of the rendered web pages locally. However, because this is a static site, you can upload the repository (without rendered web pages) to GitHub to host the website. Do ensure that GitHub Pages is enabled for the repository in the settings.

Generating the applet figures and geospatial information requires Python with a few modules. These are listed in the `requirements.txt` file to aid in installation using pip, but they can also be installed manually.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After the Python modules are installed, you need to download the data, either using the `download_data.sh` script if you have curl installed or manually from `https://lecuyer.aos.wisc.edu/radarlabviewerdocs/data.tar.gz`. The five data files must go in the `data` directory.

Building
--------

The figures and geospatial information can be generated by calling python on the supplied script:

```
$ python generate_plots.py
```

To only generate the rendered pages (which can then be served by other web server software such as Apache or nginx):

```
$ jekyll build --destination _site
```

To generate rendered pages and serve the website:

```
$ jekyll serve --watch --destination _site
```

The `--watch` flag regenerates the pages when any files have been modified.

Customization
-------------

Additional cases can be included by following the template of one of the scenes in `cases/`. Namely, a custom javascript defining a few variables (like the directory location of new images and the specific crosses for case studies) as well as a markdown file are required. This hasn't really been done much, so contact for more information.

Map and Libraries
-----------------

Included in this repository is a version of the [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) library to display the slippy map. Map tiles are available for the Western Hemisphere in zooms from 3 to 7 at https://github.com/ethan-nelson/radarlabviewertiles. (Note that if you use `git clone --recursive`, the tiles should have been already downloaded to the proper directory.) These tiles have all country borders, only have North American roads included, and only display United States city names. They are standard map tiles, so you can render custom tiles and add them to the map images directory or alternatively modify the map tile variable in `js/map.js`.
